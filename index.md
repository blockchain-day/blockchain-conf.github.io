  <summary>Yahya Shahsavari (ÉTS Montreal): Performance Modeling and Analysis of the Bitcoin Inventory Protocol</summary>

**Abstract**: Blockchains are currently gaining attention as a newly emerging technology in both academia and industry, capable of impacting a variety of domains beyond cryptocurrencies. Performance modeling can be used to provide us with a deeper understanding of the behavior and dynamics within blockchain peer-to-peer networks. Blockchain system architects can leverage network models to properly tune their system and to reduce design costs significantly. In this paper, we focus on the original and well-established Bitcoin blockchain network. In particular, we propose a random graph model for performance modeling and analysis of the inventory-based protocol for block dissemination. This model addresses the impact of key blockchain parameters on the overall performance of Bitcoin. We derive some explicit and closed-form equations for block propagation delay and traffic overhead. We implement our model using the popular network simulator OMNet++. We validate the accuracy of our theoretical model and its implementation with our dataset mined from the Bitcoin network. Our results show the trade-off between the default number of connections per node, network bandwidth, and block size in order to compute the optimal block propagation delay over the network.
  
**Speaker Bio**: Yahya Shahsavari earned a BSc in Electronics Engineering from the University of Zanjan, and an MSc in Information and Communication Technology from Iran University of Science and Technology, Iran, in 2008 and 2016 respectively.

  <summary>Claudio Miceli (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro): A smart contract for patient records in odontology school</summary>

**Abstract**: In this presentation we intend to discuss the smart contract developed to attend the UFRJ's School of Dentistry. This smart contract was used to register and validate the patient activities on the clinic. Also the smart contract is used to register the students activities regarding those patients. Later the smart contract adds another layer regarding a professor validation over the patient analysis done by the students. In this way all patients and student activities can be monitored and evaluated. If needed this is also a way to provide legal evidence.

  <summary>James Webster (Penn State), Michael Steward (Penn State):  Granting and revoking permissions using a distributed ledger, at a global scale</summary>

**Abstract**: Our project seeks to design a globally scalable system to grant permissions, and to enable prompt global revocation of those permissions. We use a blockchain to coordinate consensus on a canonical representation of the permission, and Bloom filters to broadcast early revocations. Previous systems do not envision a global, compact, timely broadcast of the kind of information necessary to enable fine-grained trust relationships to be built up between strangers. Recent work on blockchains has shown the way to use distributed control to achieve global consensus on a canonical, tamper-resistant database. We use a blockchain in our system as a flexible and global root of trust, as a way for oracles to make broadly applicable and verifiable statements that can be used to anchor other parts of our system, to limit the damage caused by stolen private keys, and for an anti-spam function. We use Merkel trees to achieve compact proofs that a permission is registered in the blockchain at a particular point in time. We use Bloom filters to broadcast compact proofs that a particular permission has not been revoked at a given point in time. For our blockchain framework we have chosen Hyperledger Fabric and implemented a network of peers residing on different computers and communicating using a peer-to-peer protocol. We discuss strategies for mending broken permission chains, and strategies for expressing permissions in a language that is flexible and actionable. Our system enables strangers meeting anywhere in the world to present a document which proves through a chain of facts that they have some particular permission. These facts can be verified by seeing that they have been digitally signed a relevant authority, whose authority can be established using the same system back to some suitable root of trust, and they have not expired or been revoked. On this basis, the strangers can make a decision about whether or not some action should be permitted with a higher level of confidence that would otherwise be possible.

**Speaker Bio**: James Webster works as a Research Engineer for the Applied Research Laboratory at Penn State, developing new applications for recent innovations in software technology. He has experience with process optimization, software development, system integration and automation. James has experience applying distributed computer systems, including blockchain systems like Hyperledger to solve logistics challenges.

  <summary>Andreas Schaad (University of Applied Sciences Offenburg): Using a secure element as a blockchain oracle</summary>

**Abstract**: Blockchain frameworks enable the immutable storage of data. A still open practical question is the so called “oracle” problem, i.e. the way real world data is actually transferred into and out of a Blockchain while preserving its integrity. We present a case study that demonstrates how to use an existing industrial strength secure element for cryptographic software protection (Wibu-Systems CmDongle) to function as such a hardware-based oracle for the Hyperledger Blockchain framework. We also present a real world business case that motivated this work (https://www.wibu.com/de/blog/article/cmdongle-in-a-hyperledger-blockchain.html).

**Speaker Bio**: Andreas Schaad is a Professor of IT Security at the University of Applied Sciences Offenburg. Before that he worked at Wibu-Systems AG Corporate Technology, as well as in various technical and managerial IT Security roles for Ernst & Young, SAP Research Security & Trust and HUAWEI Security Research. He holds 13 international patents and authored over 50 peer-reviewed publications in the domain of IT Security.

  <summary>Victor Ermolaev (Bitfury), Albert Dercksen (Nedap):  Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</summary>
  
**Abstract**: The notion of physical security in business has evolved from asset protection to assurance of critical business processes. Globalization and digital transformation are increasing the pace of business and life in general which leads to new and more dynamic risks on business continuity. Mitigation strategies require more fluid access control policies which are better able to capture the dynamics of an organization. Policy changes reflect cross cutting concerns from multiple stakeholders and can easily result in inconsistencies which may result in serious security risks. To ensure transparency and accountability of the access control policy updates during their life cycle, we introduce a blockchain-based approach. We discuss the relevance of our proposed solution on the basis of a typical security investigation scenario in which access control policy reconstruction is required to discover the root cause of an incident. We will argue that current best practices built on good intentions and best effort of operators and security administrators are not capable of delivering the required levels of immutability and trustworthiness of the audit logs. If the stakes are high, next level solutions are needed. Our solution addresses accountability, removes single points of failure, provides a verification framework and ultimately results in better business continuity at lower costs.

**Speaker Bio**: Albert Dercksen completed MSc in Applied Mathematics and later worked in the maritime technology sector. His main interests were in the field of numerical fluid dynamics applied to floating offshore constructions. In 2000, he joined Nedap Security Management as head of product development. Based on extensive experience with physical access management in large, multinational organizations, he now leads a multidisciplinary innovation team to explore and develop new conceptual models for physical access management.

  <summary>Layth Sliman (EFREI): Towards Blockchain-Based Collaborative Enterprise</summary>
  
**Abstract**: Nowadays, we witness the emergence of new collaborative business models such as virtual
market places, sharing economy, Remote Fabrication and distributed supply chain. This
has been geared by the rise of new IT technologies, namely Internet of Things technologies
and cloud computing.
Despite the advantages of these scenarios, managing security and trust are major obstacles
that should be studied to spread the collaboration intensive business.
One of the most promising technology that can cope with these issues is distributed ledger
technology. Distributed ledger technology e.g. Blockchain is a technology that provides a
decentralized “database” on a network that is scalable, secure, tamper-proof, and accessible
by each peer on the network. However, distributed ledger technologies are basically
designed for financial application. Consequently, these technologies are, so far, not adapted
to the development and the execution of collaborative business process necessary to meet
business needs.
In this talk, I will try to answer the questions: how to enable distributed ledger based
infrastructures so that they can meet collaborative business needs? What are the
fundamental obstacles in the current distributed ledger technologies state that hinder the
support of the business collaboration? At what levels in distributed ledger architecture the
changes are needed?

**Speaker Bio**: Completed his Diploma in Computer Engineering. Then he obtained his masters in Computer
Science (Information systems) in INSA Lyon- France and then his Phd from INSA Lyon, in
collaboration with the University of the Ryukyus, Japan. In 2003, he underwent training in
Development and Implementation program in Computer Software Applications in CMC-
TATA, New Delhi, India. In the same year, he also underwent another training in Information
and Communication Technologies in MEIO University and Okinawa International Center,
Japan. In 2008, 2009 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014 he did many research stays on Digital
Rights Management and image processing in the University of the Ryukyus and Ritsumeikan
University - Japan. During the period 2000-2010, he worked as lecturer and assistant
professor, did his research and taught Computer Engineering and Information Systems in
many universities including INSA, Lyon, the University of the Ryukyus in Japan, Beijing
University of Technology, South China University of Technology China, and the Insitute of
