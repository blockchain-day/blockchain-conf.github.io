## Objectives

The objective of this one-day workshop is to bring blockchain researchers and 
practitioners together and discuss opportunities to exploit blockchain and DLTs across a variety of application domains. 
Furthermore, this workshop will also examine the state-of-art in blockchain research, and challenges to be solved in order to improve usability and adoption of the technology.

The workshop aims to provide a balanced outlook and is designed for wide audience of industrial and academic participants. There will be a broad range of talks to cater to both beginners and advanced blockchain users. Furthermore, the talks will range from applications and experiences using DLTs to theoretical, technical, and system-oriented topics.

## Structure
We are soliciting participants to present their work at the workshop. We are looking for (but are not limited to) the following types of talks:
1. Presentations of **previously published** conference or journal articles at other venues
2. Presentations on **ongoing**, unpublished, research (can optionally be part of the SACMAT proceedings)
3. Presentations on the design, implementation, and evaluation of **novel use cases** for blockchains
4. Presentations on **adoption roadmap**, technical and non-technical barriers, especially in **industry**
5. Presentations of **vision/blue-sky** topics or **position papers**
6. Presentations on **related aspects** to blockchains (e.g. cryptocurrency mining, exchanges, etc.)

## Topics (not limited to this list)
1. Integration of access control technologies with DLTs
2. Cryptography mechanisms for blockchains
3. Application domains for blockchains (e.g., eHealth, IoT, supply chains, real estate, etc.)
4. Scalability and performance of blockchain systems
5. Security, privacy, and trust in blockchains
6. Consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof-of-work, Proof-of-stake, PBFT, Merkle DAG, etc.)
7. On-going research in popular blockchain systems (e.g. Ethereum, Hyperledger, etc.)
8. Layer 2 and off-chain solutions (e.g., State channels, Plasma)
9. Smart contract languages, modeling, and verification
10. Theory, cryptoeconomy, and attacks of blockchain systems
